# _[B2B LE Cart Upload]_

#### _Enable users to add items to their cart using a text list or a CSV file_

#### Adding tens or hundreds of items to your cart is very time consuming. Even using the Quick Order widget requires many clicks to add just ten items. This component enables your users to add items to the cart with just a few clicks!

The B2B LE Cart Upload component enables users to add tens or hundreds of items to the cart with just a few clicks. Input can be in the form of a CSV file, or simply pasted into a text area within the component. The component verifies all items to be added using the product search API. Users can optionally check a box to ignore invalid SKUS during processing. Users can also optionally send a transcript of the upload results to their email address. The component also fully supports internationalization. You can add translations to the custom labels the component uses, so that all text within the component will be displayed in your user's local language.

## Internationalization ##

### Custom Labels ###

The cart upload component fully supports internationalization.  You can translate all of the labels and messages displayed by the component into all languages your store and community support.  Just go into **Setup - User Interface - Custom Labels**, and translate the labels with the **b2bcu** namespace.

To make this task easier, you can create a **new view** of the custom labels that only include those from the **b2bcu** namespace:

In the **Select the filter criteria**, select
